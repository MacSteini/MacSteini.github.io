## Why Does This Even Exist?

Excellent question. Some say MacSteini created this site to show off. Others believe it was to fill the void in the cosmic comedic universe. Meanwhile, the truth is simpler: it’s a creative playground, a digital sandbox, and a place to store questionable jokes.

**In short:** Because why not?

## What’s Inside? (Probably)

- **Breathtaking Home Page**: Gawk at its minimalist design, carefully curated by an advanced AI (a cat walking on a keyboard).
- **Random Tidbits**: You might find personal musings, cryptic humour, or the occasional reason for existential dread (like JS frameworks).
- **Visual Whimsy**: Pictures, GIFs, and maybe that bizarre clipart from the mid-2000s. You know the one.

Basically, imagine a fancy museum – then remove the Monet, add some random code, and replace the security guards with inflatable dinosaurs. It’s kinda like that.

---

## Technical Nonsense (Because We Must)

- **Language**: Ancient incantations known as HTML and CSS (with the occasional dash of JavaScript).
- **Hosting**: Don’t look behind the curtain, but it’s on GitHub Pages.
- **Magic**: A combination of coffee, lack of sleep, and at least 12 tacos… Not necessarily in that order.

If technical nonsense had an official sponsor, it would be leftover pizza.

## How Do I Gaze Upon This Magnificence?

1. **Step One**: Lower your expectations.
2. **Step Two**: Point your browser to [macsteini.github.io](https://macsteini.github.io/).
3. **Step Three**: Prepare to be dazzled or confused (possibly both).

Congratulations, you’ve made it. Should your soul require more excitement, press `F5` repeatedly for a thrilling refresh experience.

## Contact / Summon / Mind-Meld

- **Carrier Pigeon**: Hasn’t worked since 1820, but you’re welcome to try.
- **Telepathy**: Must level up your psychic powers to at least level 47.
- **GitHub Issues**: The modern approach. Probably the easiest way to throw suggestions or bug reports into the digital void.
- **Email/Socials?**: Who needs ‘em when you have cosmic synergy, amirite?
